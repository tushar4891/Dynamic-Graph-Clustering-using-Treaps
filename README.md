# Dynamic-Graph-Clustering-using-Treaps-Data-Structure

Social networks are represented as graphs. Since graphs in social 
networks comprise a large number of vertices and edges, adjacency 
matrix is considered to be an effective and efficient technique to 
represent them.  
Here intent is to replace the adjacency matrix to space efficient data 
structure and cluster the graph. 
A special data structure Treap , a combination of Binary search Tree and 
Heaps has been used as a replacement to a large adjacency matrix.
